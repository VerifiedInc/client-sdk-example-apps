## Overview

This repository contains a collection of example applications demonstrating how to integrate the [Verified.inc Client SDK](https://docs.verified.inc/sdk-reference/installation) across different frameworks and technologies. These examples serve as practical reference implementations to help developers quickly incorporate Verified.inc's identity verification capabilities into their own applications.

## Example Applications

This repository includes implementations for the following frameworks/technologies:

| Framework                      | Description                             | Path                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [Angular](./examples/angular/) | Implementation for Angular applications | [`/examples/angular`](./examples/angular/) |

## Getting Started

## Core Integration Concepts

Across all framework implementations, these examples demonstrate the following key concepts:

1. **SDK Installation** - How to properly install and import the SDK
2. **Initialization** - Configuring the SDK with your session key
3. **UI Integration** - Mounting the verification UI within your application
4. **Event Handling** - Responding to verification events (success, failure, cancellation)
